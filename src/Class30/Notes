Set:
  Sets do not allow duplicate values.there are three main types of Sets
  HashSet LinkedHasSet TreeSet

HashSet:(most widely used)
  Upside: Speed its the fastest
  Downside: It does not maintain the insertion order

LinkedHasSet:
Upside: Maintains the insertion order
  Downside: Slower than HashSet

TreeSet:
  Upside : keeps the data sorted
  DownSide: its slower than all.

Map:
Maps allow us to store data in the form of key value pairs.just like sets we have three main types of maps as well
HashMap   LinkedHashMap TreeMap
