Exception:
Exception is an unwanted behavior which occurs at run time and makes our programs terminate abruptly
Exception handling:
Exception handling is a mechanism that allows us to avoid runtime errors and helps us convert complex error
messages to something simpler that a normal user can understand.
we have new keywords and How do we implement exception handling in java:
we have new keywords which allow us to handle exceptions in java.
Blocks of code 1-try 2-catch 3-finally
Keywords  4-throw 5-throws

Try block:
in the try block we write the code which may throw an exception
Catch block:
contains the backup code , the code that we want to execute in case of failure ,
it can also contain code to simplify the error messages it can also contain the code which might send a notification
or an email to the developers or admins in case of failure
How it works:
We can have multiple catch blocks with one try block .each handling a differnet error
we can also put a last catch block with exception class so that if something goes wrong
and there is no specific catch block to handle it the exception
Finally block:
