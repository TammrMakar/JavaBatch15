Interface:
interface is very similar to an abstract class.It is a contract between unrelated classes .
we can use it to achieve abstraction.all methods are public by default and abstract as well .all


Methods (Most Important)
String Class =
Loops
Arrays
Variable types in Java
Access Modifier (Skim)
Constructor
this (keyword)
Inheritance (Cucumber Class)
Super (very rare)
Overriding
Implementing an interface
Polymorphism
Final Keyword( maybe not )
abstraction (important but not all the details)
interface (important)
Encapsulation(not important for selenium)

important to review before selenium:
class 3: casting
nested (skim)
operators (skim)
class 6: loops
arrays
class 10: objects & methods
String class (ignore string builder)
Methods (the most important)
local / instance / static
access modifiers (skim)
constructor
inheritance (for cucumber but not selenium)
class 20: method overriding
polymorphism
final
abstraction
