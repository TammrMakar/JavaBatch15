FileHandling:
Reading and  writing data to files is called filHandling .
1-to read or write teh data first we need to know the path or location where we will be  reading or writing that file.
2-we need to navigate to that location or bring the file into the memory so that java program can process the data from that file.
we use two classes to navigate one is called FileInputStream and the other one is called FileOutputStream.
when we have to read the data we use FileInputStream and when we have to write the data we use the FILeOutputStream.
3-We need to know about a class that knows how to read and write the data from that specific file for examples
we use Properties class when we have to read the data from the .properties file.we use XSSFWorkbook to read and write the data from the excel files.
Whe should we learn about fileHandling?
1-we will be storing data like username passwords URLs type of browser etc.in configuration files.
2-when we need to perform data driven testeing we will be  storing and reading all the data from files like xlsx or csv files.
How to read /write data from files
1-Get the path
2-use FileInputStream/FileOutputStream to navigate.
3-use a specialized class like properties or XSSFWorkBook.

What are Exception?
Exceptions are runtime issues taht can stop normal of our programs and can abruptly terminate the progress
which is very bad and leads to bad user experience.
Exception Handling:
we stop the program from terminating abruptly , and we try to mitigate the issue we provide a backup code.
and convert the rror messages to simple text.
